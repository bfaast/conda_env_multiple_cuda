There are instances where one wants to install multiple cudatoolkits for example different versions for tensorflow and pytorch.
Here its assumed that there are two conda environments for tensorflow and pytorch.
go to the following directory-

C:\Users\<user-name>\anaconda3(miniconda3)\envs\<env-name>\etc\conda

Paste these two directories inside it.
Create the required directories (i.e etc, conda) if needed.
